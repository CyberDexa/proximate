# 🔧 WAKE UP DATABASE VIA SQL EDITOR

## 🎯 Try This Method

Since your project status is green but the database isn't responding to external connections, let's wake it up:

### Step 1: Go to SQL Editor
1. In your Supabase dashboard for project `avkfuvhroesfbqiwehiv`
2. Click on **"SQL Editor"** in the left sidebar
3. You should see a query editor

### Step 2: Run a Simple Query
Copy and paste this query and click **"Run"**:

```sql
SELECT 
  current_database() as database_name,
  current_user as user_name,
  version() as postgres_version,
  now() as current_time;
```

### Step 3: Check the Result
- If it runs successfully ✅ - the database is awake!
- If it fails ❌ - there might be a deeper issue

### Step 4: Try Creating a Test Table
If the first query works, try this:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS wake_up_test (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

INSERT INTO wake_up_test DEFAULT VALUES;

SELECT * FROM wake_up_test;
```

## 🎯 What This Does
- **Wakes up** the PostgreSQL database
- **Tests** if we can create tables
- **Confirms** the database is ready for our schema

## 📋 After Running the Query
Let me know:
1. **Did the query run successfully?**
2. **What output did you see?**
3. **Any error messages?**

Then I'll try the Prisma schema push again!

**Try running that SQL query and let me know what happens!** 🚀
